Calculating distances in different formats is hard, so we would like a program to do this for us.

Write a class called Converter.

Criteria:
The user will input a length and a unit when declaring an object from the class—for example, c = Converter(9,'inches').
For each of these units there should be a method that returns the length converted into those units. For example, using the Converter object created above, the user could call c.feet() and should get 0.75 as the result.
Use meters as base unit to convert to and from (this prevents rounding errors)
Units:
    inches
    feet
    yards
    miles
    kilometers
    meters
    centimeters
    millimeters
Input example:
    c = Converter(9,'inches')
    print(c.feet())
Output example:
    0.75
